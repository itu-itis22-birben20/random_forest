accuracy: 0.7377
recall: 0.6489
precision: 0.8531
f1_score: 0.7371

result: I ran this program multiple times and scores tendt to be between 0.65-0.82.
I can say that our program is precise (having high presicion score),
meaning that when it predicts a label is positive it will be positive probably.
Though it has a relatively low recall rate (not that bad though) meaningg that,
it is missing some actual positive labels and misclassifying them as negative.
Overall, f1_score and accuracy rates are good. So I guess this program is good to 
use on this data set. Though again one might be able to find better results
using different algorithms, for now random forest performed good on this dataset.
