accuracy: 0.9150
recall: 0.8687
precision: 0.9306
f1_score: 0.8986

result: I ran this program multiple times and scores tendt to be between 0.85-0.95.
It has a high presicion rate. Meaning that if algorithm predicts that
a label is 1 it probably is. Recall rate is a bit lower though, meaning that it is missing some
true labels. Overall, f1_score and accuracy rates are good. So I guess this 
program is good to use on this data set. Though again one might 
be able to find better results using different algorithms, 
for now random forest performed good on this dataset.
Note: I could increase scores further by increasing max_depth parameter of desicion trees
on random_forest.py file. currently it is 10 (a high number, if it is taking too low set around 4)
Also it is not actually a good idea to use high depth as it will overfit (we did not test
wheter it overfits in this hw, we did not split test-set, training-set)
