accuracy: 0.8395
recall: 0.9102
precision: 0.8247
f1_score: 0.8653

result: I ran this program multiple times and scores tendt to be between 0.8-0.88.
It has a high recall rate. This might be because we didn't have training and
test split. Overall, f1_score and accuracy rates are good. So I guess this program is good to 
use on this data set. Though again one might be able to find better results
using different algorithms, for now random forest performed good on this dataset.
