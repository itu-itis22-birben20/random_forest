accuracy: 0.8303
recall: 0.6781
precision: 0.9067
f1_score: 0.7759

result: I ran this program multiple times and scores tendt to be between 0.75-0.85.
It has a high rpesicion rate. Meaning that if algorithm predicts that
a label is 1 it probably is. Recall rate is low though, meaning that it is missing some
true labels. Overall, f1_score and accuracy rates are good. So I guess this 
program is good to use on this data set. Though again one might 
be able to find better results using different algorithms, 
for now random forest performed good on this dataset.
